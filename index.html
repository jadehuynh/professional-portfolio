            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="para">Right out of high school I attended the University of Minnesota for their Interior Design program. It seemed only natural since my older sister was an architect and I thoroughly enjoyed art as an outlet. I then withdrew from the University after a semester understanding it was not fulfilling to me. Hard choices such as that are not easy to follow through with, but I knew deep down it was not the right path. I then attended Le Cordon Bleu and finished my degree in becoming a professional Pastry Chef. 
                    Growing up I had a difficult time fitting in at school being a shy young girl. It was like I was always trying to find my identity since my parents are immigrants from Vietnam. Starting out in Faribault, Minnesota isn’t exactly the worst place to be. A gorgeous rural town it is and I’m proud to say I grew up there. I’ve always had challenges emotionally and mentally growing up. Slowly I have been healing through Origami. It has been a type of therapy for me and is on a much deeper level of connection.&nbsp;
                    All I ever did was listen to my heart and my gut and it has never led me astray. Hard work, persistence, patience, support, but really embracing the road of creating art has brought to my life is something nothing can ever replace to come close to. Cheers to following your heart.
