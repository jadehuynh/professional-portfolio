                <p class="para">Right out of high school I attended the University of Minnesota for their Interior Design program. It seemed only natural since my older sister was an architect and I thoroughly enjoyed art as an outlet. I then withdrew from the University after a semester understanding it was not fulfilling to me. Hard choices such as that are not easy to follow through with, but I knew deep down it was not the right path. I then attended Le Cordon Bleu and finished my degree in becoming a professional Pastry Chef.
